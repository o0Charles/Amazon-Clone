Look at the structure, we have a class header with
multiple childrens.

Then one of the is header__nav wich has the options. The options (called like that
because of convenction) are the left thing of the header wich displays a little menu list.

For it to work, we must render the header component in App.js by importing it from
Header.js

    import Header from "./Header";

-------------- After creating the checkout route ----------

If we look at the App.js, we can see that the Header is outside the switch. Why? well
this is because if we dont do this, the header will keep instancing itself everytime
we change the page (route) because its repeated, we should not waste effort in writing
<Header /> two time or more when we can write it once.
