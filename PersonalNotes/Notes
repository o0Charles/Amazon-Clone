The header in amazon (for example) refers to all that black band at the top
and the body to the complete page. Thats why we will be creating diferent js
files refering to all of the components that we need.

So that black brand at the top will be in the file "Header.js" with capital H
because its a COMPONENT.

    NOTE: Be sure to have intalled the extention ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
    in VS code. To search it, on the left side of VS (CTRL + b) there is the extensions tab
    write es7 and the it is.

    This will help to be faster in the develepment by providing shortcuts.

so when writing rfce on a js file it will render a complete functional component structure.

    Another extension in prettier - code formatter. on settings (CTRL + ,) search for
    format and there is a format everytime you save. Also search for autosave to autosave.

The App.js is like our main "function" its the center of our app.

By using the terminal (in this case by cd amazon-clone) you can insert icons by installing
Material Icons for React. There it will show you all the commands you will need for npm
and after that you can insert icons or even fonts.


------------------------ Currency format

You can intall it by using the next command:
    npm i react-currency-format

This will make it very easy to display currency format
then import it:

import CurrencyFormat from "react-currency-format";
<CurrencyFormat/>

*REMEMBER that you can autoimport with CTRL+Space



Until now, all the compiling errors have been beacause of the sytaxis.
