For making a an extenden page, we must create a new terminal
and there we will access to the created react-app
in this case (amazon-clone) with the command:
    cd
after that we will intall a react router with this command:
    npm install react-router-dom

Then in the App.js, import this:

    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

Then we must wrap the entire app within <Router></Router> and the make use of <switch>
for every new page that we want to go we will use <Route path="[Name of the route]">. <Route/>
And inside we will put the COMPONENTS that we want to display in that route.

When onclick we want to go to another site (or page), we will use <Link to=""><Link/> (for example
look at login__image inside Login.js)

For more information of what to do, see comments in App.js
