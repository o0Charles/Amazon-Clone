React Context API/ REDUX

This is a data layer where we can store information to use it later.

1.- Make a StateProvide.js File
2.- Paste the following:

import React, {createContext, useContext, useReducer} from "react";

// Prepares the dataLayer
export const StateContext = createContext();

// Wrap our app and provide the Data layer
export const StateProvider = ({reducer, initialState, children}) => (
    <StateContext.Provider value={useReducer(reducer, initialState)}>
        {children}
    </StateContext.Provider>
);

// Pull information from the data layer
export const useStateValue = () => useContext(StateContext);

3.- Warp the <App/> in index.js with <StateProvider ...> 
    ***for more information compare with index.js

4.- Create a reducer.js file
    A reducer actually allows us to dispatch the information to the data layer
    Is like the bridge between the data and the datalayer. (also works as the bridge
    between the data layer and the place where we want to put that info)

    It know what to do when you add or remove an item from the basket.

    Also look at reducer.js for more info.

remember all the autoimport in index.js

Some notes with this API ---------------------

For using variables (in this case the ones from the basket) we use {var} like this inside
the html code. This variables are declared at the begining of the function (as its expected)
Also for getting to the atributes of the items inside the data layer, just use the normal sintaxis
as other programing languages {basket.length} for example.
