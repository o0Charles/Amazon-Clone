ls - to know you are in the right folder (if not there show you where to "cd")

npm start

That way we can see the app on the browser, the directory and network direction.

On firebase click web icon and name the app. and register app.

at stage 3 of fire, copy the command and run it on the terminal.

	first write "sudo " (IF ON MAC!, else ignore this)
	and afterwards the command, like this:

	sudo npm install -g firebase-tools

the on firebase (in the console) go to the proyect settings and scroll down all over
to the firebase SDK snippet. Change from automatic to config

copy the code and make a new file in the proyect folder "src". This file should say:

firebase.js

and copy there the code (remember to save everytime)


With that and the react logo spinning on the browser we are ready to start!!!


--------------------
extra

We can delete app.test.js, logo.svg and setupTests.js

Since it will show a compiling error, go to App.js and delete all the header that contains
the compiling error.

Also delete the logo import (line 2), else it will cause problems.

	Tip: add this code replacing the header:

	<h1>Hello, lets start this proyect!</h1>

Go to App.cs and delete everything

Go to index.css to delete the top margin at top with:

* {
	margin:0;
}

Go to App.js and add the comment  //BEM (as for the convetion) below the return(

its a the naming convention for styling
